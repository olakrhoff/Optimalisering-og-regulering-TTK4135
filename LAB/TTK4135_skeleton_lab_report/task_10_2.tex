\section{10.2 - Optimal Control of Pitch/Travel without Feedback }

\subsection{The continuous model}
\textit{Answer 10.2.1.1}

\subsection{The discretized model}
\textit{Answer 10.2.1.2. Remember to document the calculations.}

\subsection{The open loop optimization problem}
\textit{How is it formulated?}

\subsection{The weights of the optimization problem}
\textit{Plot both the state and input trajectories for the various weights, q. Comment the results with respect to the different weights chosen.}
\textit{If you have answered the "For the daring" questions from 10.2.1.3, include the answer here.}

\subsection{Experimental results}
\textit{Printouts of data from relevant experiments (plots).
Discussion and analysis of the results.
Answer 10.2.2.7 here.}

\subsection{MATLAB and Simulink}
\textit{Code and diagrams go here (only lines that you've written yourself). Give some explanation of the code if necessary.}
